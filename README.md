This repository contains a bug report and solution for a common Dapp error: incorrectly assuming that a contract always has a balance. The bug is demonstrated in `bug.sol`, while the corrected code is in `bugSolution.sol`. The issue arises when attempting to retrieve the balance from a contract that might not have one, causing runtime errors. The solution involves carefully handling potential exceptions and checking for valid responses from the contract.
